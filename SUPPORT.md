The [NI Linux RT Discussion Forums](https://decibel.ni.com/content/groups/ni-linux-real-time) are an excellent resource for finding others working with and working on this platform.

* If you're running into issues, this is an excellent place to bring up those issues (other users may have already run into the issue and found a fix/workaround)
* If you'd like to request changes, this is a great place to make your voice heard. Of course, pull-requests are always welcome.
